# rn-dev-agent-plugin

## 0.45.0

### Minor Changes

- 5c4ca04: Add the read-only observability UI (D1226 "watch the agent live"): an in-process recorder + opt-in SSE server serving a React SPA (timeline | device | state). New `observe` MCP tool + `/rn-dev-agent:observe` slash command. Deep-redacted (args + payload, fail-closed), localhost-only with Host-header + Sec-Fetch-Site guards.

### Patch Changes

- c4804dc: Add `cdp_dismiss_dev_client_picker` MCP tool (Android) and best-effort Dev
  Client picker dismissal after Android deep links (#136 sub-3). Routed through a
  single guarded `clearDevClientPickerIfPresent()` helper; iOS returns an
  actionable manual-select message instead of touching the legacy agent-device
  path. Cross-platform iOS support tracked as a follow-up.
- 2c82b18: Fix iOS runner auto-install and stop force-installing agent-device on iOS-only setups.

  - **rn-fast-runner now self-builds on first use.** `startFastRunner()` falls back to a full `xcodebuild test` (build + test) when no prebuilt `.xctestrun` exists, instead of always using `test-without-building` (which failed on a fresh machine where `build/DerivedData` is gitignored and never produced). The first `device_snapshot action=open` on a clean clone now succeeds — it just cold-builds the rig once (ready-signal timeout widened to 360s for that path). Steady-state spawns still use the fast `test-without-building`.
  - **agent-device install is gated on a live Android target.** The SessionStart hook (`detect-rn-project.sh`) no longer runs `npm install -g agent-device` unconditionally. Since D1219/PR #164 iOS device control is owned by the in-tree rn-fast-runner, so agent-device is Android-only; the install now only runs when `adb devices` shows a booted device/emulator. iOS-only macOS users stop paying for a dependency they never use.
  - `/setup` and `/doctor` now offer to run the one-time `xcodebuild build-for-testing` pre-build to move the cold-build cost out of the first interaction (the lazy fallback covers correctness; pre-building just avoids the slow first call).

## 0.44.45

### Patch Changes

- Deliver the GH #186 maestro-interop fixes that merged in #188 without a version bump (closes #189).

  - `cdp_run_action` now allows `runFlow` (including `when:` conditionals and `{file}` sub-flows) through the Maestro command allowlist, so actions with conditional dialog-handling (Expo dev-server picker, iOS "Open in" dialog) replay through the canonical runner instead of hard-failing with `Command not in allowlist: runFlow (Phase 134.1)`.
  - Non-destructive runner-leak `reacquire` recovery tier + cross-tool CDP re-pin, avoiding the ~44s relaunch / ~47s STALE_TARGET when maestro-mcp and rn-dev-agent contend for the same iOS device.
  - Structural route-drift detection: a stale-selector failure on an inserted screen is classified `ROUTE_DRIFT` instead of triggering a wasted fuzzy-repair.

  #188 shipped these to `main` with no version bump, leaving them undeliverable to marketplace installs; this patch publishes them.
