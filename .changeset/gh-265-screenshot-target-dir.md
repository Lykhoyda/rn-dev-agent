`device_screenshot` no longer blames "device transitioning state" when the target directory doesn't exist (GH #265).

- `captureAndResizeScreenshot` now `mkdir -p`'s the parent of the derived output path before any dispatch tier runs (simctl raw, rn-fast-runner, agent-device daemon/CLI, adb stream) — new directories are the expected case, since the tool's own advisories steer agents toward fresh `docs/proof/<slug>/` paths. The fix covers `device_screenshot`, `device_batch` auto-captures, and `proof_step`, all of which funnel through the same helper.
- When the directory itself cannot be created (e.g. a file blocks an intermediate path segment), the tool short-circuits before probing any device and returns an honest `SCREENSHOT_FAILED` with `reason: 'target-dir-unavailable'` naming the offending path — never the device-state guess.
