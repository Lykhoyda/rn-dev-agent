Fix iOS runner auto-install and stop force-installing agent-device on iOS-only setups.

- **rn-fast-runner now self-builds on first use.** `startFastRunner()` falls back to a full `xcodebuild test` (build + test) when no prebuilt `.xctestrun` exists, instead of always using `test-without-building` (which failed on a fresh machine where `build/DerivedData` is gitignored and never produced). The first `device_snapshot action=open` on a clean clone now succeeds — it just cold-builds the rig once (ready-signal timeout widened to 360s for that path). Steady-state spawns still use the fast `test-without-building`.
- **agent-device install is gated on a live Android target.** The SessionStart hook (`detect-rn-project.sh`) no longer runs `npm install -g agent-device` unconditionally. Since D1219/PR #164 iOS device control is owned by the in-tree rn-fast-runner, so agent-device is Android-only; the install now only runs when `adb devices` shows a booted device/emulator. iOS-only macOS users stop paying for a dependency they never use.
- `/setup` and `/doctor` now offer to run the one-time `xcodebuild build-for-testing` pre-build to move the cold-build cost out of the first interaction (the lazy fallback covers correctness; pre-building just avoids the slow first call).
