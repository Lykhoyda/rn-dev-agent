#202 Phase 2a: a process-wide in-memory `DeviceSessionArbiter` now serializes the three device-control planes — `flow` (Maestro) is exclusive; `introspection` (CDP reads) and `interaction` (`device_*`) coexist. A read or tap issued while a Maestro flow is running refuses fast with `BUSY_FLOW_ACTIVE` instead of interleaving with it. The flow tools (`maestro_run`, `maestro_test_all`, `cdp_auto_login`) park the in-tree fast-runner for the flow's duration and mark CDP stale afterward so the next read reconnects. Diagnostics (`cdp_status`), connection management, and session-less tools stay unarbitrated and always work; a wedged arbiter (a leaked plane lease) is cleared via `cdp_status({ resetArbiter: true })`.
