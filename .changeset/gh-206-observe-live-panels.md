`/observe` device panels now refresh live (GH #206).

The observability layer was a passive recorder of tool observations — the screenshot only updated on `device_screenshot` calls and the route only on navigation-family tools, so driving the app with `cdp_interact`/`cdp_navigate` left both panels stale. A fire-and-forget hook now captures a fresh screenshot (simctl/adb, OS-level) + route (CDP nav-state) after each state-mutating tool and delivers them via a dedicated live SSE channel (`{type:'live'}` + `/api/live-screenshot`), so the timeline stays clean. Platform resolves from the active device session or the connected CDP target (so a purely CDP-driven flow with no agent-device session still refreshes). Gated on a connected `/observe` tab, skipped during Maestro flows, single-flight trailing-coalesce, opt-out with `RN_OBSERVE_LIVE=0`.
