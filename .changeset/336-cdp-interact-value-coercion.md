fix(interact): cdp_interact no longer corrupts react-hook-form Controller-wrapped inputs (#336). `setFieldValue` keeps a string a string for string-typed fields (a digit-string injected as a number is coerced back to string only when the field currently holds a string — number/boolean fields are untouched). `press` gains an optional `value`: when provided, `onPress` receives the value instead of a synthetic event, so radio/chip-style controls whose onPress sets a form value select correctly. HELPERS_VERSION bumped to 33.
