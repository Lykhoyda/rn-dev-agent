Bump esbuild to 0.28.1 across the build toolchains to clear the HIGH Dependabot advisory (GHSA-gv7w-rqvm-qjhr).

The advisory is in esbuild's Deno installer (binary-integrity RCE via `NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY`) — a code path this repo never executes (esbuild is consumed as an npm transitive dep via Vite/Astro, not Deno), so it was never exploitable here. Still, both the observability web UI (`scripts/cdp-bridge/src/observability/web/`) and the docs site carried the vulnerable transitive esbuild, so both now pin it to the patched 0.28.1 via an npm `overrides`. The observability Vite build also sets `build.target: 'esnext'` (it's an internal localhost-only dev tool viewed in a modern browser) to sidestep an esbuild 0.28 regression that refused to downlevel destructuring to Vite's default old-browser baseline; the single-file bundle was rebuilt. `npm audit` is clean in both subtrees.
