fix(#253): `cdp_repair_action` no longer hardcodes `targetPlatform='ios'` — Android auto-repair works against an emulator. The repair orchestrator now derives the platform from the active device session via `detectPlatform()` (booted-device probe fallback when no session is open; `'ios'` only as the final no-session, no-device fallback). Previously an Android repair foregrounded the app via `xcrun simctl`, snapshotted through the iOS short-circuit, and bootstrapped the iOS fast-runner — so Android selector drift always escalated as a hard failure instead of self-healing.
