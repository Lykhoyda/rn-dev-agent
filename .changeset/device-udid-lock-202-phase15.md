#202 Phase 1.5: iOS `device_snapshot action=open` now takes a persisted, UDID-scoped simulator-ownership lock — closing the multi-bridge race where two Claude Code windows (two bridge processes) could drive the same simulator. The second bridge gets a `DEVICE_BUSY` error. The lock self-heals via PID-liveness + a 30s heartbeat (reclaimable once the holder PID is dead or its heartbeat is >90s stale), so it cannot orphan like the legacy `daemon.lock`; on an fs error it fails open (logged) rather than blocking a session.
