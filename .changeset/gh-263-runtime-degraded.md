`maestro_run` now flags a wedged simulator runtime (GH #263).

When a flow fails AND the median latency of its successful `tapOn` steps exceeds a floor (default 1500ms, `RN_RUNTIME_DEGRADED_FLOOR_MS`), the result gains a `RUNTIME_DEGRADED` hint and `meta.runtimeDegraded` — "the simulator test runtime is likely wedged; reboot it (xcrun simctl shutdown/boot), relaunch, and retry." This replaces the misleading "Element not found" that previously sent the agent chasing app code when the real cause was a degraded simulator (taps reported success but `onPress` never fired). Detection is purely additive — it never changes a pass/fail verdict, never fires on a passing run, and only counts successful taps (a failed tap's duration is the step timeout, which would otherwise false-positive an ordinary element-not-found failure). Fail-open: unparseable output → no hint.
