#202 Phase 6 / #186 — foreign Maestro sessions become arbiter refusals; plugin maestro_run is the canonical surface.

While a foreign Maestro/XCUITest session drives the target simulator (UDID-scoped detection, 5 s TTL, fail-open), local `device_*` and flow tools refuse fast with `BUSY_FOREIGN_FLOW` (~50 ms measured) — pointing at the safe L1 reads — instead of colliding into the ~44 s runner-leak cascade. L1 introspection stays free; `device_screenshot` serves pixels via its simctl fallback; a ~10 s teardown grace after the plugin's own flows prevents self-false-positives while WDA dies. The two historical reasons to leave the plugin surface are live-gate-verified closed and #201 is closed — including a new fix: the clearState `--app-file` resolution is snapshotted outside the device container (the installed-container path used to be deleted by clearState itself before the reinstall could read it). `RN_IOS_FOREIGN_GUARD=0` disables both the warning and the refusal (`RN_IOS_FOREIGN_WARN=0` remains a deprecated alias). The foreign-runner `ps` scan now uses `-ww` (command-column truncation could silently drop the UDID → false negatives).
