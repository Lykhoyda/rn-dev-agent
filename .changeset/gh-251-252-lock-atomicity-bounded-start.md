fix(#251,#252): startup hardening. The project single-instance lock (`Lockfile.acquire`) now uses the same atomic `openSync('wx')` exclusive-create pattern as `DeviceLock` — the previous read-then-write let two bridges starting in the same instant both "acquire" the lock, with the second silently truncating the first; the loser now gets a structured conflict, stale-holder reclaim narrows the steal window with a re-read before unlink, and fs infra errors fail open (`degraded: true`) instead of crashing the bridge at boot. Separately, SessionStart is now bounded: the hook declares an explicit 120s timeout and the maestro-runner installer's `curl | bash` carries `--connect-timeout 10 --max-time 90`, so a stalled CDN can no longer block session start indefinitely; a CI guard (`session-start-bounded.test.sh`) pins both.
