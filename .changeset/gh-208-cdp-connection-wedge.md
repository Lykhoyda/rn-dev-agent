Fix the CDP connection wedge (GH #208): `cdp_status` no longer dead-locks on "Already connecting to Metro..." and no longer misreports a detached app as "Metro not found". Three root causes were addressed:

- **RC1 — reconnect-storm wedge.** When the app detaches but Metro stays up, the WS-close reconnect loop holds `isReconnecting()` true for up to ~12 min (30 attempts × 30s cap, then re-armed indefinitely by the background poll). `autoConnect`'s guard threw "Already connecting" for every `cdp_status`/`cdp_*` call in that window. `cdp_status` now **preempts** an active reconnect storm via `softReconnect()` (the existing 3s `softReconnectRequested` handshake) for one fresh attempt instead of refusing, and surfaces the live `reconnectState` (attempt N/30) on any connect failure so it reads as progress, not a dead end.
- **RC2 — misleading error.** "Metro up but 0 Hermes targets" now throws a typed `AppDetachedError` ("Metro is up … advertises 0 Hermes debug targets — the app isn't attached") instead of being conflated with the genuine "Metro not found" (now reserved for `discoverMetroPort` returning null).
- **RC3 — no auto-recovery.** New `recoverDetached()` cold-restarts a detached iOS app (`simctl terminate` + `launch`) → reconnects → confirms with a real CDP liveness probe. Bounded to 3 consecutive attempts/session, skips while a Maestro flow holds the arbiter lease, iOS-only, opt-out via `RN_AUTO_RELAUNCH_ON_DETACH=0`. Cold-restart (vs recover-wedge's bare launch) is acceptable because it only fires when the app is ALREADY detached — never against a working app.

Hardened via a Codex + Gemini multi-review: `cdp_status` now honors an explicit `args.platform` during a storm (tears down + reconnects rather than reusing the storm's target), auto-relaunch is skipped when the caller pinned a non-iOS platform (never cold-restarts an unrelated iOS session), `simctl launch` failures are surfaced instead of hidden behind "still detached", and the post-recovery status read can no longer throw out of the handler.

19 new unit tests; full suite 1729/1729; `tsc --noEmit` clean. Live false-positive guard verified: the real `discover()` against Metro does not fire `AppDetachedError` while a target is present. Scoping: the literal-0-targets case is fixed; the RN-0.85 "C++ target present, 0 Hermes" flavor remains B156/B184 territory (recover-wedge path). (GH #208, B181, D1245)
