Add the read-only observability UI (D1226 "watch the agent live"): an in-process recorder + opt-in SSE server serving a React SPA (timeline | device | state). New `observe` MCP tool + `/rn-dev-agent:observe` slash command. Deep-redacted (args + payload, fail-closed), localhost-only with Host-header + Sec-Fetch-Site guards.
