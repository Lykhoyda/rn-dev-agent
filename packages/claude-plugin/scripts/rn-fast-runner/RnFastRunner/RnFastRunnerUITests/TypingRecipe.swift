// typed immediately after keyboard appearance (autocorrect warm-up,
// hardware-keyboard arbitration), so the `type` handler (a) never types before
// the keyboard is up and (b) sends the first character as its own burst, waits
// out the drop window, then streams the remainder. Pure logic lives here so
// the unit suite can cover it without a simulator UI.
