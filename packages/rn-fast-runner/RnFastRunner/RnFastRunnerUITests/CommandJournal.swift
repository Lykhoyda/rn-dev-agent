// Story 14 (#407): bounded journal of recent /command outcomes so the client
// can distinguish "never executed" from "executed, response lost" after an
// ambiguous transport failure. All access happens on the runner's single
// serial dispatch queue ("rn-fast-runner.runner"), so no locking is needed.
// Heavy payloads (snapshot nodes, screenshot base64) keep only their state —
// both verbs are read-only, so the client may safely re-send instead.
