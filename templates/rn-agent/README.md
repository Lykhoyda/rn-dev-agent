# `.rn-agent/` — `rn-dev-agent` plugin home

This directory is the **plugin's home in your project**. Files here are
managed by the [`rn-dev-agent`](https://github.com/Lykhoyda/rn-dev-agent)
Claude Code plugin. One folder, one doctrine — the plugin's entire
footprint is `.rn-agent/` and it does not read or write anywhere else
in your project.

If your project also has a `.maestro/` folder for hand-authored E2E
tests, that's yours alone. The plugin doesn't read it.

> **One small exception:** if the agent lands on a login screen and
> finds a `.maestro/subflows/login.yaml` (or `sign_in.yaml`,
> `auth.yaml`, `register_user.yaml`, `flow_start.yaml`), it can use
> that subflow to log in. This is a read of *your* content, not plugin
> territory.

## Lifecycle of an action

1. **Discovery** — `cdp_record_test_start` → `…_stop` buffers events to
   `recordings/<id>.json`.
2. **Save** — `cdp_record_test_save_as_action` writes the paired
   `actions/<id>.yaml` + `state/<id>.state.json` (sidecar). The YAML is
   the executable test; the sidecar holds runtime metadata (revision,
   status, `runHistory[]`, `repairHistory[]`).
3. **Replay** — `/run-action <id>` (calls `cdp_run_action`) runs the
   flow and updates the sidecar.
4. **Self-heal** — on a `SELECTOR_NOT_FOUND` failure, `cdp_repair_action`
   uses live device introspection to patch the YAML in place, bumps the
   sidecar `revision`, and demotes `status` to `experimental` until the
   next clean replay.
5. **Compact** — `/rn-dev-agent:rn-agent-compact` periodically flags
   cold (90+ day), flaky (>50% fail), or high-churn actions for
   human review. Deletion is human-in-the-loop.

Self-repair is bounded: max 3 attempts per action per 24h; failure codes
other than `SELECTOR_NOT_FOUND` escalate without auto-fix.

## Cleanup

`/rn-dev-agent:rn-agent-compact` surfaces a corpus health report:

- Actions not run in 90+ days (cold storage candidates)
- Actions repaired 5+ times in 30 days (high-churn → consider redesign)
- Actions with `failureCount/totalRuns > 0.5` (flaky)
- Actions with overlapping `intent` (potential duplicates)

The report is informational; deletion stays a deliberate human gesture.
