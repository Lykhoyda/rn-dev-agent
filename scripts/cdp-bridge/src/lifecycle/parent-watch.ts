 * GH #182: one tick of the parent-death watch. Compares the bridge's *current* PPID
 * against the PPID it observed at startup. If it CHANGED, the original parent (the
 * Claude Code host) died and the bridge was reparented (to init, launchd, or a
 * subreaper) — it's now a LIVE orphan still holding the single-instance lock, so
 * trigger onOrphaned (self-exit). Otherwise onHeartbeat (refresh the lock).
 *
 * We compare against the initial PPID rather than testing `=== 1` so a bridge whose
 * Claude Code host runs as PID 1 (a container with no init system) does NOT
 * self-exit on every tick — its PPID is legitimately 1 and never changes while CC
 * is alive (Gemini HIGH). Subreaper reparenting (PPID → some non-1 PID) is caught too.
 * Pure + injectable so the decision is unit-tested without timers or real PPIDs.
