# rn-dev-agent-cdp

## 0.38.40

### Patch Changes

- Deliver the GH #186 maestro-interop fixes that merged in #188 without a version bump (closes #189).

  - `cdp_run_action` now allows `runFlow` (including `when:` conditionals and `{file}` sub-flows) through the Maestro command allowlist, so actions with conditional dialog-handling (Expo dev-server picker, iOS "Open in" dialog) replay through the canonical runner instead of hard-failing with `Command not in allowlist: runFlow (Phase 134.1)`.
  - Non-destructive runner-leak `reacquire` recovery tier + cross-tool CDP re-pin, avoiding the ~44s relaunch / ~47s STALE_TARGET when maestro-mcp and rn-dev-agent contend for the same iOS device.
  - Structural route-drift detection: a stale-selector failure on an inserted screen is classified `ROUTE_DRIFT` instead of triggering a wasted fuzzy-repair.

  #188 shipped these to `main` with no version bump, leaving them undeliverable to marketplace installs; this patch publishes them.
