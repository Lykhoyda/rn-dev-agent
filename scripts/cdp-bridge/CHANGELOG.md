# rn-dev-agent-cdp

## 0.39.1

### Patch Changes

- 6e8af52: Fix a batch of bugs, regressions, and reliability issues surfaced by a multi-agent repo audit.

  **Security**

  - Redaction no longer leaks private-key material. `redactString` now applies secret patterns BEFORE truncating (a >2000-char PEM previously had its `-----END-----` marker severed by truncation so the key body passed through), and the PEM rule now matches multi-word labels like `RSA PRIVATE KEY` / `OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY` (the old single-word pattern never matched the most common headers).

  **Device interaction**

  - `device_scroll` no longer throws on Android (and on the iOS fast-runner fallback): a direction-form scroll is now converted to coordinates before dispatch, matching `device_swipe`.
  - `device_batch` scroll steps no longer crash the whole batch on either platform (same root cause).
  - A coordinate `device_swipe` with `--count`/`--pattern` but no `durationMs` no longer mis-parses the flag value as a 3 ms duration on iOS (the positional extractor now strips flag values, matching Android).
  - The Android runner is no longer reused across emulators: `shouldReuseAndroidRunner` checks the bound `deviceId` (parity with iOS `shouldReuseRunner`), so a runner bound to one emulator can't silently drive another.
  - A wedged-but-alive fast-runner is now reaped: `ensureFastRunner` probes tri-state liveness instead of PID-only, so a hung HTTP listener no longer makes every subsequent command burn the full timeout.
  - `ensureSingleRunner` is now awaited at session-open so the stale-runner kill completes before the first interaction, and its `ps` failure surfaces as a warning instead of a silent no-op.

  **Actions / Maestro**

  - Actions now auto-promote `experimental → active` on the first clean replay (the documented lifecycle was defined + tested but never wired).
  - The GH#186 route-drift guard is now active in production (`cdp_run_action` is wired with a CDP-backed live-route reader; it previously defaulted to a no-op).
  - `maestro_test_all` and the inline Maestro fallback no longer mark passing flows as failed when app/console output merely contains `Error:`, and both now auto-resolve `--app-file` for iOS `clearState` flows (previously only `maestro_run` did). `clearState` detection also recognises the standalone `- clearState` command.
  - All Maestro `execFile` calls raise `maxBuffer` to 10 MB so a large flow log can't kill the child and mask a passing run.
  - `cdp_repair_action` `RUNNER_LEAK` refusals are now bucketed as `SNAPSHOT_FAILED` in MTTR telemetry instead of `INTERNAL_ERROR`.
  - A bare-form `id:` repair now emits a quoted scalar, so a testID containing YAML-special characters can't corrupt the action.

  **Reliability / correctness**

  - `collect_logs` no longer double-shifts Android logcat timestamps by the host UTC offset (which corrupted both the time and the cross-source merge order).
  - CDP freshness/dev probes attach a no-op catch to the raced `evaluate()` promise so a mid-probe WebSocket close can't surface as an unhandledRejection.
  - The observability server keeps a small `headersTimeout` (slow-loris guard), broadcasts a `shutdown` event so the browser stops auto-reconnecting after stop, and `Recorder.clear()` notifies subscribers instead of orphaning live SSE streams.
  - Action IDs now accept dots (`v2.0-login`) per their documented contract while still rejecting `..`.
  - The post-edit health-check hook's "app not installed → skip" guard works again (`grep -c || echo "0"` produced a two-line `0\n0`).
  - `learned-actions` resolves the project memory dir correctly for paths containing a dot, and its `${VAR}` extractor accepts digit-bearing keys.
  - The injected-helpers version is a single source of truth (the post-injection log no longer reports a stale `v11`).
  - `sync-versions.sh` drops a dead, misleading variable and documents that `rn-dev-agent-cdp` is independently versioned.

  Hardened the previously flaky `proof_step` unit tests (they depended on a machine-global session file) with a dependency-injection seam, making the suite deterministic.

## 0.39.0

### Minor Changes

- 5c4ca04: Add the read-only observability UI (D1226 "watch the agent live"): an in-process recorder + opt-in SSE server serving a React SPA (timeline | device | state). New `observe` MCP tool + `/rn-dev-agent:observe` slash command. Deep-redacted (args + payload, fail-closed), localhost-only with Host-header + Sec-Fetch-Site guards.

### Patch Changes

- c4804dc: Add `cdp_dismiss_dev_client_picker` MCP tool (Android) and best-effort Dev
  Client picker dismissal after Android deep links (#136 sub-3). Routed through a
  single guarded `clearDevClientPickerIfPresent()` helper; iOS returns an
  actionable manual-select message instead of touching the legacy agent-device
  path. Cross-platform iOS support tracked as a follow-up.

## 0.38.40

### Patch Changes

- Deliver the GH #186 maestro-interop fixes that merged in #188 without a version bump (closes #189).

  - `cdp_run_action` now allows `runFlow` (including `when:` conditionals and `{file}` sub-flows) through the Maestro command allowlist, so actions with conditional dialog-handling (Expo dev-server picker, iOS "Open in" dialog) replay through the canonical runner instead of hard-failing with `Command not in allowlist: runFlow (Phase 134.1)`.
  - Non-destructive runner-leak `reacquire` recovery tier + cross-tool CDP re-pin, avoiding the ~44s relaunch / ~47s STALE_TARGET when maestro-mcp and rn-dev-agent contend for the same iOS device.
  - Structural route-drift detection: a stale-selector failure on an inserted screen is classified `ROUTE_DRIFT` instead of triggering a wasted fuzzy-repair.

  #188 shipped these to `main` with no version bump, leaving them undeliverable to marketplace installs; this patch publishes them.
