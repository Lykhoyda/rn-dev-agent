// GH #182 RC-A: the bridge self-exits when its Claude Code host dies, even when
// stdin-EOF and signals don't fire. Detection is "parent CHANGED from the PPID
// observed at startup" — NOT "PPID===1" — so a container where CC runs as PID 1
// (devcontainer/no-init) never false-self-exits, and subreaper reparenting is caught.
// (Multi-review: Gemini HIGH / Codex C1.)
