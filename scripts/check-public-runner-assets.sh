# committed trust root from release v<plugin version> and fails on a missing
# release or asset, a draft, or any SHA-256 / length difference. Nothing here
# ever rebuilds, replaces or re-hashes a public byte.
#
# A checkout whose version AND root manifest equal its base (BASE_REF for pull
# requests, EVENT_BEFORE for pushes) stays offline: those bytes were asserted
# when they landed.

# Usage: check-public-runner-assets.sh [--repair]
#   --repair  re-upload a MISSING runner-manifest.json asset from the trust
#             root (needs contents: write). A divergent asset is never repaired.
