# "Updated dependencies" dropped), and a missing section must fall back to the

# rn-dev-agent-plugin

## 1.0.8

### Patch Changes

- f1d414e: Print snapshot and find element refs as `@eN`, matching the pinned form the current frame authorises for press, and accept a copied bare `eN` at the argv boundary (GH #979).
- fa2cd21: Refuse managed-dev-client replay of flows that clear app state, and make login-path refusals name the actual next step.
- bc86d57: Add the `rn-pr-qa` agent and `/qa-pr` workflow so a GitHub PR can be device-tested on iOS simulator, Android emulator, and physical device.
- Updated dependencies [f1d414e]
- Updated dependencies [fa2cd21]
  - rn-dev-agent-core@1.0.8

## 1.0.7

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [b352043]
  - rn-dev-agent-core@1.0.7
