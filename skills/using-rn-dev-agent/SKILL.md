  Entry point for the rn-dev-agent plugin. Maps user intent to the right
  command, agent, or skill. Use at the START of any React Native
  development conversation. Triggers on "I want to build", "build a feature",
  "add a feature to the app", "test this", "something is broken", "fix the

# Using rn-dev-agent

The React Native development plugin for Claude Code. **51 MCP tools**, **5 agents**, **13 commands**, **6 skills**.

This skill is your front door. Before starting any RN work, use the decision tree below to route the user's intent to the right tool.

## Decision Tree

```
What is the user asking for?

## Core Operating Behaviors

These apply to every RN task:

### Always
1. **Start with `cdp_status`** before any app interaction or feature verification
2. **Use MCP tools** (`cdp_*`, `device_*`) for app state reads — never raw bash
3. **Verify with evidence**, not intuition — CDP output, screenshot, store state
4. **Do cross-platform checks** unless the user explicitly scoped to one platform
5. **Filter `cdp_component_tree` queries** — never dump the full tree (10K+ tokens wasted)
6. **Stop at the first red flag** from the agent's red flags list

### Ask First
- Adding new dependencies to the user's project
- Changing navigation structure (route names, param types)
- Modifying existing store shape (breaks existing consumers)
- Creating more than 5 files for a single feature
- Disabling existing tests

### Never
- Use `xcrun simctl` or `adb` for app interaction (use MCP tools)
- Bypass `cdp_status` with direct WebSocket calls
- Claim a feature works without Phase 5.5 evidence
- Refactor code adjacent to your change ("while I'm here")
- Add features not in the feature description
- Rename MCP server keys in minor/patch versions (D605)

## Skill Map

| Skill | Type | When loaded |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `using-rn-dev-agent` (this) | Meta / entry point | Start of any RN conversation |
| `rn-setup` | Process | User runs `/rn-dev-agent:setup` or tools fail |
| `rn-feature-development` | Process | Inside `/rn-dev-agent:rn-feature-dev` — 8-phase pipeline |
| `rn-testing` | Reference + process | Test writing, Maestro flows, E2E verification |
| `rn-debugging` | Reference + process | Diagnosing crashes, errors, blank screens |
| `rn-device-control` | Reference | Simulator / emulator commands, screenshots |
| `rn-best-practices` | Reference | 46 RN rules for architecture + review |

## Agent Map

Two categories — invocation pattern matters:

### Parent-session-only agents (MCP-bound — NEVER spawn via Task tool)

These agents' protocols require `cdp_*` / `device_*` MCP tools, which don't
propagate to spawned subagents (GH #31). They are **protocol playbooks** —
read them as reference, execute the steps INLINE in the parent session.

| Agent | Model | Purpose | How to invoke |
|-------|-------|---------|-----------|
| `rn-tester` | sonnet | Verify feature works live on device | Run `/test-feature` — protocol executes inline in parent session |
| `rn-debugger` | opus | Diagnose broken screen, apply fix | Run `/debug-screen` — protocol executes inline in parent session |

### Spawnable agents (read-only — safe to use via Task tool)

These use only `Glob, Grep, LS, Read` — no MCP tools. They can be spawned
in parallel via the Task tool for concurrent codebase analysis.

| Agent | Model | Purpose | How to invoke |
|-------|-------|---------|-----------|
| `rn-code-explorer` | sonnet | Map feature implementation across layers | `Task(subagent_type='rn-dev-agent:rn-code-explorer', ...)` — typically × 2-3 in parallel during `/rn-feature-dev` Phase 2 |
| `rn-code-architect` | opus | Design blueprint with proof flow | `Task(subagent_type='rn-dev-agent:rn-code-architect', ...)` — typically × 1-2 during `/rn-feature-dev` Phase 4 |
| `rn-code-reviewer` | sonnet | Review for bugs + RN convention violations | `Task(subagent_type='rn-dev-agent:rn-code-reviewer', ...)` — typically × 2-3 in parallel during `/rn-feature-dev` Phase 6 |

## Common Rationalizations

Agents skip this skill at the start of conversations. Don't.

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "The user asked a specific question — I'll answer directly without routing" | You lose the workflow gates. `/rn-feature-dev` wouldn't skip Phase 5.5; neither should an ad-hoc answer. |
| "I know what `cdp_store_state` does — skip reading rn-debugging" | Skills are not API docs. They contain the process knowledge (when to combine tools, when to fallback). You need that context. |
| "The user said 'fix the bug' — I'll just edit the file directly" | Route to `/rn-dev-agent:debug-screen` which runs the rn-debugger protocol inline in the parent session. Enforces reproduce → diagnose → fix → verify. Never spawn `rn-debugger` via Task tool — MCP tools won't work (GH #31). |
| "I'll spawn `rn-tester` via Task to verify while I work on something else" | You can't — MCP stdio doesn't propagate to Task-spawned subagents (GH #31). rn-tester and rn-debugger are parent-session-only protocol playbooks. Only `rn-code-explorer`, `rn-code-architect`, `rn-code-reviewer` are safe to spawn (they're read-only, no MCP). |
| "This is a trivial change — I'll skip Phase 5.5 verification" | Trivial changes are where verification gates matter most. They're the ones you tell yourself don't need testing. They do. |

## Red Flags — Stop and Reconsider

If you notice yourself doing any of these at the start of an RN task, stop:

- About to edit code without first reading `cdp_error_log` or `cdp_component_tree`
- About to run `xcrun simctl` or `adb` instead of an MCP tool
- About to claim "feature works" without any `device_screenshot` or `cdp_*` output
- Skipping `/rn-dev-agent:setup` because "tools probably work"
- Starting feature development without `/rn-dev-agent:rn-feature-dev`
- Spawning `rn-tester` or `rn-debugger` via Task tool — their protocols need MCP tools that don't propagate to subagents (GH #31). Run `/test-feature` or `/debug-screen` instead; the protocol executes inline in the parent session.
- Spawning an agent without the matching skill loaded in context
- Answering "is this broken?" without running `cdp_status` first

## Failure Modes — Common Plugin Workflow Drift

Things that repeatedly go wrong, cataloged for prevention:

| Failure | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Feature ships with broken Android | Skipped `cross_platform_verify` | Always run it in Phase 5.5 unless explicitly scoped |
| "Works on my machine" bug | Claimed done without Phase 5.5 evidence | Every row in the results table must have a concrete Evidence value |
| Native crash missed entirely | Only checked `cdp_error_log`, not native logs | Use `collect_logs(sources=["js_console","native_ios"])` together |
| Wasted 10K tokens on component tree | Called `cdp_component_tree()` without filter | Always filter by testID or component name |
| Tests silently broken after refactor | No Maestro flow exists | `/rn-dev-agent:proof-capture` generates one; use it |
| CDP session lost mid-task | Another debugger (DevTools, Flipper) connected | Close all other debuggers before starting |

---

## Verification — Session Ready When

Before starting any real work, confirm:

- [ ] `cdp_status` returns `ok:true` with `cdp.connected: true`
- [ ] The user's intent has been routed to a specific command OR agent (not freestyled)
- [ ] The matching skill is loaded for the work type (testing, debugging, feature-dev)
- [ ] If feature-dev: user's feature description is concrete enough for Phase 1

If any of these fail, address them before proceeding.
